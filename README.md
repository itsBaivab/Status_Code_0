## About

Cryptic Wizards proudly presents an innovative solution developed for the MLH Hackathon, designed to enhance child safety and identification. Our project, the **QR Art Generator**, leverages stable diffusion and control net techniques to generate captivating AI art QR codes. These QR codes can be used as stylish stickers or badges on a child's belongings. In the unfortunate event that a child goes missing, the QR code can be scanned to access vital information through a hosted PDF, aiding in their safe return.

## Features

- Generate AI Art QR codes using stable diffusion and control net techniques.
- Create custom QR codes by filling out a user-friendly form containing essential child details.
- Host generated QR AI art on a PDF via [ttm.sh](https://ttm.sh/) for easy access.
- Utilize the Hugging Face Spaces API for AI art generation using the `controlnet_qrcode-control_v1p_sd15` model.
- Enhance child safety by attaching QR codes as stylish stickers or badges on bags or clothes.

## How It Works

1. Users fill out a form with the child's information, such as name, date of birth, contact details, school, and more.
2. The provided information is uploaded to [ttm.sh](https://ttm.sh/) to generate a hosted PDF containing the child's details.
3. The link to the hosted PDF is then passed to the Hugging Face Spaces API, which utilizes the `controlnet_qrcode-control_v1p_sd15` model to generate a unique AI art QR code.
4. The generated QR AI art can be downloaded and printed as stickers or badges to be attached to the child's belongings.
5. In case of an emergency or if the child is lost, anyone can scan the QR code to access the child's details through the hosted PDF link, facilitating a swift and safe return.
